      <description>The new website is out, finally. It&amp;rsquo;s not that it took these many days to work on this or something, but, while changing jobs and coming to master&amp;rsquo;s, I just could not find time to do this. But good that I have deployed it in this at least now.
About this website I have used Hugo static site generator to build this site and the theme name that I am using is called the Coder theme.</description>

      <description>This article is not some magical spell kind of an essay that makes you devoid of the curse known as ‚ÄúProcrastination‚Äù, so it is better to keep aside your expectations and enjoy this small yet interesting post.
Many a times in our lives we get bright ideas such as, an idea for the next unicorn startup, a solution for the traffic problem in Bangalore, or even smaller scale ideas like, garbage disposal problem in your house, keeping the house clean, organising ourselves, etc.</description>
