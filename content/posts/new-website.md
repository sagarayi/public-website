The new website is out, finally. It's not that it took these many days to work on this or something, but, while changing jobs and coming to master's, I just could not find time to do this. But good that I have deployed it in this at least now.

#### About this website
I have used Hugo static site generator to build this site and the theme name that I am using is called the [`Coder`](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/) theme. The main reason that I chose this theme is that it is clean, minimalistic and non-cluttered. Also, the information that I would want the visitor to know is easily visible. 

Another important feature of this website is that I am posting my blog posts in this site itself, just so that I get a sense of hosting my content on my site and not some third party site like Medium. I would now try to put in more content in that section from now on.

That is all about the new site if you would like to check out the old site or miss it, here is the link to it.

Enjoy the new site and let me know how do you feel about the new layout.
